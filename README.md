## Description

This is a burger logger application that was built with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. MVC design pattern was followed, Node and MySQL were used to query and route data, handlebars were used to general HTML.

The application allows a user to add a list of burgers they want to eat, after devouring a burger they will click a button and move it to the burgers eaten list and they will be given an opportunity to re-order that burger for future consumption.
